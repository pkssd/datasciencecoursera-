# Code Book

This __code__ __book__ describes the structure and the variables of the data set "tidy_dataset_with_avg.txt", resulting from executing the "run_analysis.R" script.

Raw data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Full description of the raw data: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones  

You can easily read the resulting data set using the command read.table:
df<-read.table("tidy_dataset_with_avg.txt", header=TRUE)



The resulting data frame is composed of 180 observations (rows) and 88 variables (columns).

There is a total of 30 observations for each subject studied. In total, 6 subjects were observed.

* Column 1 "subject": is a numeric identifier of the subject who performed the activity

* Column 2 "activity_type": identifies the type of activity performed by the subjects. It's a factor variable and there are 6 possible levels: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS.

* Columns 3 to 88: these are all numeric variables and represent measurements taken using the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial when the subject moved. Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation have been included.
